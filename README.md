# **Zomato-Data-Analysis-EDA-Project**

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset focused on restaurants in Bengaluru. The main objective was to understand dining trends, popular cuisines, rating patterns, and the distribution of restaurants across different locations in the city.

## **üìå Zomato Restaurant Dataset ‚Äì Key Insights & Recommendations:-**

1."Online order is 'Yes'" ‚Üí Gets "higher votes" and "higher ratings".

2."Book table is 'Yes'" ‚Üí Gets "higher votes", "higher ratings", and "higher average cost" for two people.

3."listed_in(type) = 'Drinks & Nightlife'" ‚Üí Gets "higher votes", "higher ratings", and "higher average cost".

4."Listed cities like 'Indiranagar' and 'Old Airport Road'" ‚Üí Have "higher votes", "ratings", and "cost for two
people".

5.If "online order = No", then "approx cost for two people is high" (indicating fine-dine or premium restaurants).

6."MG Road" and "Residency Road" ‚Üí Show "higher online orders" and also get "higher votes".

7.Locations like "Brigade Road", "Church Street", "Lavella Road", "MG Road", and "Residency Road" ‚Üí Show
"higher cost for two people" (Premium dining).

8."Most restaurants have below 7500 votes" ‚Äî only few exceed this range, indicating top performers.

9.For "restaurant types like 'Drinks & Nightlife', 'Pubs & Bars'", if "book_table = Yes", then "votes are high".

10.In "Bellandur" and "Sarjapur" areas ‚Üí Votes are "higher" because "book_table = Yes" is more common.

11.Restaurants with "online order enabled" ‚Üí Tend to get "better ratings".

12.If "table booking = Yes", then "ratings > 3.0" are common; If "table booking = No", most restaurants have
ratings "above 2.0", but a few fall "below 2.0".

13.Here,you can see the 'Chicken','Biryani',"Pizza" is a most frequent words while placed order or you can say

14You can see clearly the winner is in the category of cuisines is 'North‚Äô.

15 You can see clearly the most favourite menu item is 'Chicken‚Äô.

16You can see the most of the placed order location is 'Koramangala',& second position is 'BTM‚Äô.

17)Most of the order placed location is 'Bangalore' cause whole the dataset belongs to Bangalore.
